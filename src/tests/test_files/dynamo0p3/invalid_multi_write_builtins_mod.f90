!>@brief Broken meta-data for the Dynamo 0.3 built-in operations.
!>@details This meta-data is purely to provide psyclone with a
!specification
!!         of each operation. This specification is used for
!!         correctness checking as well as to enable optimisations of
!!         invokes containing calls to built-in operations.
!!         The actual implementation of these built-ins is
!!         generated by psyclone (hence the empty ..._code routines in
!!         this file).
