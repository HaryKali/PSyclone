# To make pyreverse provide a reasonably complete UML diagram we need to add
# in fake declarations where it does not realise there is a "has a"
# relationship. We simply qualify these with if False so they never get called.

# All fake declarations have a comment "# for pyreverse"
# The two cases that require fake declarations are
# 1: when a class creates a list of other classes,
# 2: when class names are passed by argument.

# for the dynamo 0.3 api:
pyreverse -A -p dynamo0p3 dynamo0p3.py # -A includes base classes
dotty classes_dynamo0p3.dot # to view
dot -Tsvg classes_dynamo0p3.dot > classes_dynamo0p3.svg # to generate svg
dot -Tpng classes_dynamo0p3.dot > classes_dynamo0p3.png # to generate png

# for gocean
pyreverse -A -p gocean gocean.py
dotty classes_gocean.dot
dot -Tsvg classes_gocean.dot > classes_gocean.svg

# to make the topclasses.png file I manually edited the dot file to
remove any unwanted nodes and edges then added style="filled" to the
nodes that I want to be shaded. The resultant dot file -
dynamo0p3_topclasses.dot - is kept in the doc directory for reference.
