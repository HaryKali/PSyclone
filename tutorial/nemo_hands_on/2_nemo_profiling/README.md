# Using Profiling with PSyclone and NEMO - Tutorial 2 #

This tutorial follows on from Tutorial 1 (../1_nemo_psyir/README.md) and
assumes that you are comfortable with the topics covered there. It uses
the same tracer-advection mini-app although for this tutorial it has
been refactored so that the mini-app itself is called from a separate
driver program. The reason for this will become clear as you work
through the tutorial.

You can find information on the various transformations supported by
PSyclone in the User Guide
(https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/transformations.html).

## Prerequisites ##

This example includes a Makefile to simplify the compilation process. It
assumes you are using Gnu Make. If you are using a different version of
Make then you may need to edit the Makefile and replace the "?=" with "=".

## Basic Profiling ##

1. Use PSyclone with the provided `profiling_trans.py` script in order to
   add profiling around the entire body of the mini-app. When examining the
   generated Fortran code, you should see that PSyclone has added
   ``USE profile_psy_data_mod, ONLY: profile_PSyDataType`` as well as calls
   to ``profile_psy_data0%PreStart()`` and ``profile_psy_data0%PostEnd``.

2. Compile the generated code. The code now depends upon the PSyData API
   and therefore the location of a suitable wrapper library must now be
   provided when compiling the mini-app. PSyclone is distributed with a
   simple, self-contained timing library 'simple_timing' which we will
   use here. The supplied Makefile will build this library and then
   build the tracer-advection mini-app:

    $ make tra_adv.exe

   At this point, the compiled application can be run:

    $ ./tra_adv.exe

   but no timing information is output!

3. Manually add startup/shutdown calls. No timing information is
   output because the timing library is not being shutdown. This is
   because PSyclone does not have any knowledge of the overall
   application structure and therefore it is up to the user to insert
   startup/shutdown calls in the appropriate locations.  The
   'simple_timing' library only requires a shutdown call so you will
   need to edit the generated code (psy.f90), add
   'profile_psydatashutdown' to the ``USE profile_psy_data_mod``
   statement and add a call, ``CALL profile_psydatashutdown()`` as the
   final statement before the ``END PROGRAM``.

   The compiled application should now output timing information when
   run, e.g.:

    ===========================================
    module::region   count	sum	   min		average		max
    tra_adv::r0        1   0.718750000    0.718750000   0.718750000    0.718750000    
    ===========================================


Use a transformation script to add profiling to tra_adv. Get them to
profile the whole thing, loop nests, etc. Use simple_timer to reduce
dependencies and link back to Joergâ€™s activity on PSyData. Need to
choose a suitable problem size for this.
