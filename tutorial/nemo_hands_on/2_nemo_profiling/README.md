# Using Profiling with PSyclone and NEMO - Tutorial 2 #

This tutorial follows on from Tutorial 1 (../1_nemo_psyir/README.md) and
assumes that you are comfortable with the topics covered there.


Use a transformation script to add profiling to tra_adv. Get them to
profile the whole thing, loop nests, etc. Use simple_timer to reduce
dependencies and link back to Joergâ€™s activity on PSyData. Need to
choose a suitable problem size for this.
