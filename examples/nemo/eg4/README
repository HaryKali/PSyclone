The SIR and its dawn back-end come with three examples which create
SIR using its Python Interface.

I have written a PSyIR to SIR back end which prints out the calls to
the Python interface.

I have written Fortran code that is the equivalent of the examples and
running this through PSyclone to try to produce the same (or
equivalent) SIR as is in the examples (so we know it works). The
Fortran codes are in copy_stencil.f90, hori_diff.f90,
tridiagonal_solve.f90. The names reflect the names of the SIR/Dawn
examples.

To test this run:

> psyclone -s ./sir_trans.py -api nemo <filename>

Issues/limitations:

Loop bounds are analysed yet so it is not possible to add in offset
and loop ordering for the vertical. There are also no checks that the
loops conform to NEMO lat.lon.levs and
